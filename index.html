  <p>WHAT UP!!!! My name is Patrick, and this is the first website I have ever built. I’m super happy with how it turned out.  
    With that being said this is going to get graded, so I’ll get to find out all the ways I screwed up. 
    That’s ok though. That’s why they’re the teachers and <a class="video" href="https://youtu.be/DFtbd_pd9rY?t=16" target="blank">I’m the code.. learning guy.</a>  
    Also, if this feels punchy and/or disjointed I am writing this at 2:30 in the morning... So, in the immortal words of Nux: <a class="video" href="https://youtu.be/SHAWpKFtbjo" target="blank">WITNESS ME!</a></p>

  <p>Now on to the about me. I could be described as an aspiring memelord and a consumer of fine meats and whiskeys. I have a family. 
     A fantastic two and a half year old daughter, who is already dubious of me. (she catches on quick) 
     A dog who thinks it is his duty to troll me. And an amazing wife who lovingly (begrudgingly) tolerates my increasingly obscure Simpsons references. 
     <a class="video" href="https://youtu.be/7trn91xkJ0w" target="blank">Ah, nothing can possibli go wrong…</a></p>
        
  <p>When I am not testing my family’s love for me, I can be found yelling at the Packers on TV or being waay too competitive during boardgame night with friends. 
    (I will have those sheep if it is the last thing I do Becky!) Fun fact: I have never not finished a game of Monopoly (at least as an “adult”). 
    Otherwise my life is a cavalcade of toddler activities, letting the dog in and out, and trying to go out to upscale restaurants with the Misses. 
    (she’s a foodie and has really classed up my garbage palate).</p>
